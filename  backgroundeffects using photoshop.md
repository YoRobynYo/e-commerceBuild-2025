I am trying to set a background in photoshop that copy this idea, but an image of mine for my landing page, so the idea is you can see partly through the image to see the font at the front , it looks impressive , can you help with the photoshop settings ?

Of course! This is a fantastic and popular design technique. What you're describing is creating a textured, semi-transparent overlay that allows the background image to subtly show through the text and elements in the foreground, giving it depth and a high-end, "tactile" feel.

The key to achieving this effect in Photoshop is using Blending Options and careful layer management.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on the settings and process.
The Core Concept

You will have three main layers:

    Bottom Layer: Your full-color, high-quality background image.

    Middle Layer (The "Shave/Beard/Cut" Texture): This is your semi-transparent texture (like the paper/cardstock texture in your example). It sits on top of the image but has its fill reduced so the image shows through it.

    Top Layer: Your text and other elements (like the prices, "Beak New" button). These will be 100% opaque but will interact with the layers below via blending modes.

Step-by-Step Photoshop Guide
1. Set Up Your Document

    Create a new document at the desired size for your landing page (e.g., 1920px width x 1080px height).

    Place your chosen background image as the bottom layer. Scale it to fit nicely (Edit > Free Transform or Ctrl+T / Cmd+T).

2. Create the Textured Overlay (The Key Element)

    Find or Create a Texture: You need a texture image. This could be a photo of:

        Paper (like in your example)

        Cardboard

        Concrete

        Fabric (like canvas or linen)

        Light grunge or noise

    Place the Texture: Place your texture image directly above your background image layer.

    Adjust the Texture's Opacity/Fill:

        In the Layers Panel, you will see Opacity and Fill.

        Reduce the Fill opacity (this is often more effective than reducing Opacity for this effect). Start around 30% - 50%. You should immediately see your background image showing through the texture, creating that semi-transparent look.

        Pro Tip: Try different Blending Modes for the texture layer (e.g., Multiply, Soft Light, Overlay). Each one will blend the texture with the background image differently. Overlay often gives a strong, contrasty result, while Multiply darkens the overall feel.

3. Add and Style Your Text

    Use the Type Tool (T) to create your text (e.g., "The Shave", "The Beard", prices, etc.).

    The text will naturally be 100% opaque and sit on top of everything. To make it feel more integrated and impressive, we use Layer Styles.

    Right-click on your text layer and select Blending Options....

    The two most important settings here are Bevel & Emboss and Stroke.

        Bevel & Emboss: This gives the text a slight 3D, "letterpressed" or "engraved" effect.

            Style: Inner Bevel

            Technique: Smooth

            Depth: 50-100% (adjust to taste)

            Direction: Up (for raised text) or Down (for engraved text)

            Size: 2-5 px (very subtle)

            Soften: 1-2 px

            Angle: Use global light, around 120°

            Altitude: 30°

            Highlight Mode: Screen | Opacity: ~60% | Color: White

            Shadow Mode: Multiply | Opacity: ~30% | Color: Black

        Stroke: This adds a thin, crisp border to help the text stand out against varying background colors.

            Size: 1 px

            Position: Outside

            Blend Mode: Normal

            Opacity: 80%

            Color: Choose either white (for a light halo) or black (for a dark outline), whichever creates the best contrast.

4. Create the "Badge" or "Card" Elements

    The pricing boxes in your example are separate cards. To create these:

        Use the Rectangle Tool (U) to draw a box.

        Apply the same Blending Options (Bevel & Emboss, Stroke) as your text to make it feel like it's part of the same physical material.

        Reduce the Fill Opacity of this shape layer to 0%. This is the magic trick!

            Fill: 0% makes the actual color of the shape invisible.

            However, the Layer Styles (Bevel, Stroke) remain fully visible!

            This creates the effect of a subtle, embossed box on the texture itself, without a solid block of color blocking your background.

5. Finishing Touches and Export

    Group your elements (Ctrl+G / Cmd+G) to keep your file organized.

    Add any final adjustments like a Curves or Levels adjustment layer to tweak the overall contrast and colors of the entire composition.

    When you're happy, export for web (File > Export > Save for Web (Legacy)... or Export As...) as a JPG (high quality) or PNG-24 (if you need transparency elsewhere).

Summary of Key Photoshop Settings:

    Texture Layer:

        Fill: 30% - 50%

        Blending Mode (Experiment): Normal, Multiply, Overlay, Soft Light.

    Text & Shape Layers:

        Fill: 100% for text, 0% for background shapes.

        Blending Options:

            Bevel & Emboss: For a subtle 3D effect.

            Stroke: 1px outline for readability.

        Color: Use colors that contrast well with your background. White, cream, and dark gray are classic choices for this style.

By following these steps and playing with the settings (especially the Fill opacity and Blending Modes), you can perfectly replicate that sophisticated, layered look from your screenshot using your own imagery.
