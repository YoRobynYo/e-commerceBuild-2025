 $ git commit -m "feat: Complete build system overhaul and Python dependency fixes

    🚀 Frontend Build System Improvements:
    - Modern Webpack 5 configuration with code splitting
    - Electron Builder for cross-platform packaging
    - Babel transpilation with proper target configuration
    - ESLint and Jest for code quality and testing
    - SASS compilation with source maps
    - Comprehensive npm scripts for development and production

    🐍 Backend Build System Enhancements:
    - Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized production images
    - Docker Compose configurations for dev/prod environments
    - Nginx reverse proxy with SSL termination and security headers
    - PostgreSQL and Redis integration with health checks
    - Comprehensive Makefile for build automation
    - Production deployment scripts with backup strategies

    🔧 Python Dependencies & Import Fixes:
    - Added missing OpenAI and email-validator dependencies
    - Fixed all import errors and missing model classes
    - Enhanced AI services with proper error handling
    - Added missing schemas (OrderCreate, OrderItemCreate)
    - Implemented EmailService class with logging
    - Added Cart, CartItem, and ProductView models
    - Fixed automation triggers with listen_for decorator
    - Comprehensive error handling for optional dependencies

    🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance:
    - Complete test suite for AI services
    - All imports verified and working
    - Comprehensive .gitignore for both frontend and backend
    - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
    - Security checks with Bandit and Safety
    - Code formatting with Black and Flake8

    📚 Documentation & Development Workflow:
    - Comprehensive README with setup instructions
    - Development scripts for easy environment setup
    - Production deployment automation
    - Monitoring stack configuration (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
    - Clear project structure and build instructions

    ✅ All systems now working correctly with no missing imports!" Waiting for approval...
