Phase 1: Project Setup & Configuration
This initial phase is all about getting your tools and project structure in place.

    1. Install Core Technologies:
        Install Python (version 3.9 or newer).
        Install Ollama for running local AI models.
        Install Git for version control.
    2. Set Up Your Project:
        Create a main project folder.
        Inside the folder, create a Python virtual environment (python -m venv venv).
        Activate the virtual environment (source venv/bin/activate on Mac/Linux or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows).
        Initialize a Git repository (git init).
    3. Configure VS Code (Optional but Recommended):
        Create a .vscode/ai-config.yaml file to configure the AI assistant within your code editor, defining its behavior and default tech stack.
    4. Define Project Dependencies:
        Create a requirements.txt file and add the necessary Python libraries:
            Flask (for the web server)
            Flask-CORS (for handling cross-origin requests)
            python-dotenv (for managing environment variables)
            Ollama (if using the Ollama Python library)
            groq (if using the Groq API)
            openai (if using the OpenAI API)
            httpx (for making HTTP requests to AI services )
        Install these dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
    5. Manage Environment Variables:
        Create a .env file for your local development settings (e.g., ENVIRONMENT=development, AI_PROVIDER=ollama).
        Create a .gitignore file and add .env, venv/, and other sensitive or unnecessary files to it.

Phase 2: Backend Development (Flask)
Now, let's build the server-side logic of your application.

    1. Create the Main Application File (app.py):
        Set up a basic Flask application.
        Configure logging to see what's happening in your app.
        Create a simple route (/) that renders your main HTML page.
    2. Build the AI Service (services/ai_client.py):
        This is the core of your AI integration.
        Create a class or functions to handle different AI providers (Ollama for local, Groq/OpenAI for production).
        Implement logic to switch between providers based on your environment (development vs. production).
        Add a rate-limiting mechanism to prevent abuse (especially for production).
    3. Create API Endpoints (routes/chat.py):
        Create a Flask Blueprint for your chat routes.
        Build an API endpoint (e.g., /api/chat) that:
            Receives a message from the frontend.
            Calls your ai_client to get a response from the AI model.
            Sends the AI's response back to the frontend.

Phase 3: Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
This is the user-facing part of your application.

    1. Create the Main HTML Page (templates/index.html):
        Structure the page with a chat interface: a message display area and an input form.
        Link your CSS and JavaScript files.
    2. Style the Application (static/css/styles.css):
        Add CSS to make your chat application look good and feel responsive.
    3. Add Interactivity (static/js/app.js):
        Write JavaScript to:
            Capture the user's message when they submit the form.
            Send the message to your backend API (/api/chat) using fetch.
            Receive the AI's response and display it in the chat window.
            Manage a session_id to track conversations.

Phase 4: Deployment
Once your application is working locally, it's time to put it on the internet. The guide recommends free tiers for getting started.

    1. Prepare for Production:
        Ensure your requirements.txt is up to date.
        Make sure your start command is ready for a production server (e.g., gunicorn app:app).
    2. Choose a Hosting Provider:
        Backend (Flask App): The guide recommends Render for its free tier that supports Python applications.
        Frontend (Static Files): If you decide to separate them, Netlify or GitHub Pages are great free options. For a combined app, Render will serve everything.
    3. Deploy Your Application:
        Push your code to a GitHub repository.
        Create an account on Render and link your GitHub.
        Create a new "Web Service" and point it to your repository.
        Configure the build command (pip install -r requirements.txt) and the start command (gunicorn app:app).
        Add your production environment variables (like GROQ_API_KEY and DATABASE_URL) in the Render dashboard.
        Deploy!
